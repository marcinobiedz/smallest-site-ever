I believe I have been strengthening my technical expertise and understanding of the technologies in our stack. I’ve also been taking on tasks beyond pure development, including work with Kubernetes, Docker, and environment setup. Most of my tasks were delivered on time, even when they required additional research. I’m also gradually improving my understanding of how hedge funds operate, which I hope helps me make better technical decisions. Overall, I feel I’ve been able to contribute in a steady and meaningful way this cycle.

I would like to continue developing my ability to take a more active role in discussions around feature usefulness and design. While I do contribute at times, I feel I could be more confident in expressing my views and engaging in conversations that help shape the direction of a feature early on. Strengthening these skills would allow me to communicate more clearly, collaborate more effectively across the team, and build a bit more influence during product discussions. Overall, I see these areas as meaningful opportunities for growth, even if I have already started making some progress.


This year, the achievement that stands out the most for me is maintaining a high level of productivity across a wide range of work. I delivered the vast majority of tasks on time, including those that required additional research or stepping into unfamiliar areas. Alongside this, I continued to strengthen my technical expertise, expanding my understanding of our stack and taking on work involving Kubernetes, Docker, and environment setup. I also improved my awareness of the financial context we operate in, which helped me make more thoughtful technical decisions. Overall, I feel these areas worked together, with consistent delivery being the clearest highlight of the year.


Looking ahead, I’m interested in exploring a career path that moves gradually toward either a Team Lead role or an Architecture Lead role. I would like to continue strengthening both my technical depth and my ability to support others, so that I can contribute not only through implementation but also through guiding direction and helping the team grow. I see these paths as natural extensions of the skills I’ve been developing, and I’m open to learning what would be expected from me to move in either direction.
